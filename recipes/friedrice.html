        <h3>Description</h3>

            The key to good fried rice is ensuring that the rice is dry enough to achieve a slightly crispy texture, and it's often seasoned with soy sauce, oyster sauce, or other flavorful condiments. 
            The dish is typically quick to prepare, making it a favorite for using up leftovers or as a simple, satisfying meal.
